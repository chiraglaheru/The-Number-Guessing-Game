# The-Number-Guessing-Game

A simple Python number guessing game where the computer picks a number and you have to guess it!

## Motivation
I built this project to strengthen my core Python skills—particularly with conditionals, loops, and user input handling—while creating something interactive and fun. It's a great beginner project that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in an engaging way.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/the-number-guessing-game.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd the-number-guessing-game`
3. Run the game: `python game.py`

## Usage
- Choose between 'easy' (10 attempts) or 'hard' (5 attempts) difficulty
- Enter numbers between 1-100 when prompted
- The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low
- Try to guess the correct number before running out of attempts!

## Features
- Two difficulty levels
- Limited attempts
- Interactive feedback
